# FAQ
### 1. What is `HoneygainPot`?
- `HoneygainPot` is a project using Python and utilizes GitHub Actions server to run a script/bot for claiming Honeygain's lucky pot, instead of manually running it on a ' physical ' computer, as seen in the original repository [HoneygainAutoClaim by MrLolf](https://github.com/MrLoLf/HoneygainAutoClaim).
- I've also added this feature to the original repo but cannot guarantee good support for GitHub Actions ([PR #9](https://github.com/MrLoLf/HoneygainAutoClaim/pull/9)).

### 2. What's the difference between `HoneygainPot` and `HoneygainAutoClaim`?
- `HoneygainPot` aims to provide 100% support for GitHub Actions and still supports running on ' physical ' machines ( like your computer ). I have removed features that I felt were somewhat useless, such as logging, and added a debug section for easier troubleshooting, new CLI interface. In contrast, `HoneygainAutoClaim` does not have these.

### 3. Which one should I use, `HoneygainPot` or `HoneygainAutoClaim`?
- If you want to use this script/bot online without using your computer's resources and only run the Honeygain app to earn money by sharing network bandwidth, then you should use `HoneygainPot`.
- If you want to use this script/bot on your computer, not automatically online, and don't care about the resources used, you can still use `HoneygainAutoClaim`!
